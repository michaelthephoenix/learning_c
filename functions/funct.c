A farmer has a rectangular piece of land that he wishes to divide in small rectangular
paddocks in order to properly graze his animals at the farm. The small rectangular
paddocks must be of equal size. You are required to write a C program that will request
the farmer to enter the length and width of the small paddocks. Then, the program
determines the area of each small rectangular paddock using a function which you must
later call in the main(). The program should print the size of each small paddock and the
total area that the farmer needs to make 100 paddocks.(10 Marks)
